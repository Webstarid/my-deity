This concept is modeling the neural network after a fully additive Maclaurin Series expansion of
an arbitrary polynomial. This assumes that all the representation functions learnt through
these computations can be modelled using the polynomials.

Technically, this only uses the polynomial representations and because of which, this may be
less powerful than the usual non-linear networks.
